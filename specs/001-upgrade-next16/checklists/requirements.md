# Specification Quality Checklist: Upgrade to Next.js 16 and React 19 Compiler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — NOTE: this spec is a migration spec and intentionally references Next.js and React; this is acceptable for the migration context.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) — NOTE: success criteria reference build and CI outcomes because the feature is explicitly a migration; they are phrased as observable outcomes (PASS/FAIL).
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification — NOTE: the spec contains required platform references for the migration and these are intentional.

## Notes

- Validation run: 2025-10-29 — all checklist items PASS for the migration-spec context. No outstanding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.

- Next steps: implement the migration plan in a phased manner, run dependency audit (`pnpm outdated`), update CI config,
  and produce the detailed migration guide in `docs/migrations/upgrade-next16.md`.
